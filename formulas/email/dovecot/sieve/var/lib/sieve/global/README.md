Put scripts to execute here if the user has no user rules.
Refer to the Dovecot Pigeonhole Sieve documentation for more info on global rules.

Once you have placed a script here, run the Salt formula
`email.dovecot.sieve` to have the formula compile the
Sieve scripts.  Otherwise the scripts will not be used.
