# SaltStack formula for Nextcloud on Fedora

This formula completes the initial setup of Nextcloud so that you may run the
first-run wizard on your new Nextcloud instance.  The formula uses Apache and
takes over the root of the HTTP server to directly run Nextcloud on it,
instead of as a subdirectory `/nextcloud/` on the HTTP server.

Once setup is completed, you can follow the first-run wizard and then continue
on with the [Nextcloud manual as usual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/index.html).

## Pillar data

Here is a sample pillar data file that the formula uses to customize its
operation:

```
nextcloud:
  database:
    name: nextcloud
    user: nextcloud
    password: my nextcloud database user password goes here
  admin:
    user: admin
    password: my administrative user for Nextcloud goes here
  trusted_domains:
  # The first item in this list will be the domain to which
  # the Nextcloud instance responds to (i.e. if this was
  # machine.local, then the URL that serves Nextcloud will 
  # be http://machine.local/ .
  # More domains are optionally possible too.
